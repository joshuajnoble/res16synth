These boards are for a workshop I ran at Resonate 2016 called "Volt, Amp, Synth & Sound"

I really wanted to make a simple workshop about electronics that all beginners could understand. It was a fun little exercise in making an intuitive and approachable way to learn something that is usually thought of as difficult.
